    "description": "Installs UPX (an executable packer/compressor) on nearly any platform",
    "overview": "[UPX](https://upx.github.io/) is an advanced executable file compressor. UPX will typically reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus reducing disk space, network load times, download times and other distribution and storage costs. It supports compressing a wide variety of binary-like files. Surprisingly, it even compresses executables better than WinZip. Best of all, it is free and open source.",
