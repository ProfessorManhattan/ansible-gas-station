    "overview": "[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect your .gitignore and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. This role also installs ripgrep-all. [ripgrep-all](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all) is just like ripgrep except it also searches in PDFs, E-Books, Office documents, zip, tar.gz, etc.",
