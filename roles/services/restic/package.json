    "overview": "[Restic](https://restic.net/) is a modern backup program that can back up your files from Linux, BSD, Mac and Windows to many different storage types, including self-hosted and online services. It is a single executable that you can run without a server or complex setup. It can be used to only back-up the parts of files that actually changed. It uses cryptography in every part of the process. Restic is entirely free to use and completely open source.",
