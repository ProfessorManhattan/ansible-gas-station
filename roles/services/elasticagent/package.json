    "overview": "[Elastic Agent](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation-configuration.html) is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to each host. A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy monitoring across your infrastructure. The agentâ€™s single, unified policy makes it easier to add integrations for new data sources. You can use Elastic Agent with Fleet. [Fleet](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/fleet.html) is a Kibana service that allows you to add and manage integrations for popular services and platforms, as well as manage Elastic Agent installations.",
