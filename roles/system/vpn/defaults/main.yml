# By specifying a file named OpenVPN.ovpn, the role will look for the OpenVPN.ovpn file
# in your files/vpn directory in your main playbook. At the moment, you can either provide
# an .ovpn file for OpenVPN and a .nmconnection file for WireGuard. Please post feature
# requests as an issue on the Git repository. This role will remove anything that is not
# required for the VPN connection after the role is done. This means .ovpn files are removed.
# The VPN connections are available to all users on the system (at least on Ubuntu) and any
# certificates required for the connections are stored in the root user's home directory.
